### Notes
The biggest challenge when building the app was accidentally using type "any" instead of "Any", which led to a few errors and 30+ minutes of pain and suffering. I also had struggles with updating the GIF Walkthrough. I was unable to remove the old one because of a merge failure on my own PC, so for time-saving reasons I uploaded a second GIF while retaining the original GIF in Github.
